These are external Javascripts required by OpenSprinkler software.
If you want to customize the scripts, you can make a copy of these files and put them on your own server, or github, or an available file hosting service.
The only constraint is that these scripts must be accessible through a direct http link, such as:
http://xxxx/home.js
Any file hosting service that can provide direct file access link is ok.
